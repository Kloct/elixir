# Alpha Testing

> Welcome to the Aborea Stock Exchange Alpha!

## What to Expect in this Alpha

ASE is finally entering a new develoment phase that will allow others to access some of it's analytics tools! This Alpha phase is meant to test some of the site's basic functionality while also giving users a chance to provide feedback on usability and features.

There are still many features planned for the future and they will all need to be tested before they are ready for release.

## What Qualifies as a "Bug"

A bug is any function of the website that is not working as intended. This can be something as simple as a visual elements not lining up to something major enough to affect the entire website. No bug is too small and if you find one be sure to report it so it can be fixed!

## How to Report Issues

Initially reporting will be done simply through discord dms. If you have access to the site then you'll have me added on discord so just message me there if you find anything. Eventually I may setup something on a more official issue tracker but for now Discord can work. I'll update the issues page with currently tracked issues as they are reported.

## Requesting Features

Feature requests are highly encuraged. If there is anything you'd like to see added to the site or any current features you'd like to see adjusted be sure to let me know again through Discord.
